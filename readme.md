- Developed a full-stack application to remove word bias from datasets, generating factual, unskewed information.
- Implemented a PyTorch-based algorithm leveraging BERT to tokenize and filter relevant terms, integrating with Google Geminiâ€™s API for output comparison and bias impact analysis.


The Backend is Fast API and not Node. There is a node file, so if you run npm start,
it will work because there is a connected node backend, but instead run
uvicorn app:app --reload.

You can use npm start for the frontend.
